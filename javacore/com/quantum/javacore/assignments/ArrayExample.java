//		An array of objects can hold any object that passes the IS-A (or instanceof)
//		test for the declared type of the array. For example, if Horse extends Animal,
//		then a Horse object can go into an Animal array.
		
		
//		You can assign an array of one type to a previously declared array reference of
//		one of its supertypes. For example, a Honda array can be assigned to an array
//		declared as type Car (assuming Honda extends Car).
		
//		If you assign an array to a previously declared array reference, the array you're
//		assigning must be the same dimension as the reference you're assigning it to.
